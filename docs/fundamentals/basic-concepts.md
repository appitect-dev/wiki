# Basic Web Development Concepts

This guide explains fundamental concepts in web development that every developer should understand.

## Web Application Architecture

### Frontend
The frontend, also known as "client-side", is everything that users directly interact with in their browser. It includes:
- User interface (UI)
- Interactive elements
- Visual design
- Client-side logic

Frontend developers work with:
- HTML (structure)
- CSS (styling)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (functionality)
- Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)

### Backend
The backend, or "server-side", handles:
- Business logic
- Data processing
- Database operations
- Authentication
- Security

Backend developers work with:
- Server technologies (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
- Databases
- APIs
- Server infrastructure

### API (Application Programming Interface)
An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate. In web development:
- APIs define how different parts of applications interact
- They enable data exchange between frontend and backend
- They provide structured ways to access functionality

#### REST API
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for APIs that:
- Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Is stateless (each request contains all necessary information)
- Has standardized endpoints
- Returns data typically in JSON format

Example REST API endpoints:
```
GET /api/users           # Get all users
POST /api/users         # Create a new user
GET /api/users/123      # Get specific user
PUT /api/users/123      # Update specific user
DELETE /api/users/123   # Delete specific user
```

## Development Environment

### Node.js
- A JavaScript runtime environment
- Allows running JavaScript outside the browser
- Powers many development tools
- Used for backend development

### npm (Node Package Manager)
- The default package manager for Node.js
- Manages project dependencies
- Provides access to thousands of packages
- Handles project scripts and commands

Common npm commands:
```bash
npm init              # Initialize a new project
npm install          # Install all dependencies
npm install package  # Install specific package
npm run script       # Run script defined in package.json
```

### Development Tools

#### Version Control (Git)
Git is a version control system that:
- Tracks changes in code
- Enables collaboration
- Maintains history of changes
- Allows branching and merging

Common Git commands:
```bash
git init             # Initialize repository
git clone url        # Clone repository
git add .            # Stage changes
git commit -m "msg"  # Commit changes
git push            # Push to remote
git pull            # Pull from remote
git branch          # List branches
git checkout -b     # Create and switch to new branch
```

#### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
An IDE is a software application that provides:
- Code editing
- Debugging tools
- Syntax highlighting
- Code completion
- Integration with other tools

Popular IDEs:
- Visual Studio Code
- WebStorm
- Sublime Text

## Web Technologies

### HTML
- Structures web content
- Defines document elements
- Provides semantic meaning
- Base of web documents

### CSS
- Styles web content
- Controls layout
- Handles responsiveness
- Manages animations

### JavaScript/TypeScript
JavaScript:
- Adds interactivity
- Handles user events
- Manages state
- Communicates with APIs

TypeScript (superset of JavaScript):
- Adds static typing
- Improves code reliability
- Enhances developer experience
- Better tooling support

## Modern Web Development

### Single Page Applications (SPA)
- Load once, update content dynamically
- Smooth user experience
- Reduced server load
- Managed with frameworks like React

### Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
- Work offline
- Can be installed on devices
- Push notifications
- Native-like experience

### Responsive Design
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible layouts
- Optimized images

Remember: The best way to learn is by doing. Try to build small projects that incorporate these concepts!
